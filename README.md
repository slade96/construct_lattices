# construct_lattices
***
constructing_surface_general.sage is a (rough) partial implementation of an algorithm to construct lattice surfaces with given Veech groups in given strata, based on ['Constructing lattice surfaces with prescribed Veech groups: an algorithm'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14512).  This runs on SageMath version 9.5 together with the sage-flatsurf 0.4.7 package.
